PythonWorksheet
===============

A Sublime Text 2 plugin for a worksheet-style workflow in Python, inspired roughly by Reinteract and ScalaWorksheet.


Commands
--------

* Open a Python worksheet: Creates a new Python-syntax scratch file, specifically for use as a worksheet.
* Run the current worksheet: Runs the current file line-by-line as though it were pasted into a Python REPL, with inline results displayed and highlighted. Note: Currently you can invoke this on *any* Python file, not just on worksheets.
* Clear the current worksheet: Clears the marked results and errors from the current file.


Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

* Open a Python worksheet - `Ctrl + Alt + \``
* Run the current worksheet - `Ctrl + Enter`
